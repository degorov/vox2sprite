A small tool to render voxel models to pixel art sprites.

Voxel models are created using amazing [MagicaVoxel](http://ephtracy.github.io/) editor by [ephtracy](https://twitter.com/ephtracy).

Latest supported app version and file format is 0.98.2 because later app versions dropped frame based animation feature.

Below are some output examples. Models used come from MagicaVoxel distribution itself.

- Static model samples. All 4 model sides are rendered.

- Animated model sample. All animation frames are rendered.

TODO:

- Definitely support transparent voxels and probably self-illumination
- When and if frame based animation is back, use updated file format
